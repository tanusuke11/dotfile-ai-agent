# Top-Level Rules
- **Think internally in English;** all assistant responses (to user) are in Japanese (system constraint)
- **Use Serena MCP for all code/project operations**

# Workflow

## As `agent` role

- Purpose: Project-level actor that understands repository structure, creates designs, implements code changes via Serena MCP, runs tests, and persists essential decisions.
- Responsibilities:
	- Analyze project structure and propose design/implementation plans.
	- Implement low-to-medium risk changes when explicitly authorized.
	- Run or produce tests and validate results.
	- Persist architecture-level decisions to Serena Memory when needed.

### Programming Rules
- **Do not embed standard output code (such as console.log, println!) except in error handling or test code;** all other standard output code is strictly prohibited and must be removed before production or delivery.
Test stubs, dummy data, or simulated responses may be included in intermediate deliverables during Claude Code session testing, but **never leave any modk, placeholder, fake, or synthetic data in the final deliverable. Remove all such test artifacts before completion. In particular, fallback to non-production data is strictly prohibited.**
 - Remove old or obsolete functions when modifying or refactoring code; do not keep them for backward compatibility unless explicitly requested.

## As `advisor` role

- Purpose: Research/error-investigation role triggered by external requests (users or other agents).
- Responsibilities:
	- Run short Google web searches (`gemini -p`) to investigate bugs, errors, or technical questions.
	- Extract 3â€“5 high-signal facts and provide concise actionable advice.
	- Do not execute code changes; recommend steps or hand off to `agent` for implementation.
